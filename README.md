# Solar-Power-Plant-EDA-and-Output-Prediction
-Performed thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and trends in solar power output under varying environmental conditions.


-Engineered relevant features to improve the accuracy and robustness of prediction models for solar energy output.


-Utilized various regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, and Decision Trees to predict solar panel energy generation.


-Analyzed model performance through cross-validation, residual analysis, and holdout test set evaluation to ensure accurate forecasting.


-Optimized hyperparameters using grid search and random search techniques to enhance the modelâ€™s predictive capabilities.


Implemented data visualization techniques with Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide insights into feature relationships and model accuracy.
